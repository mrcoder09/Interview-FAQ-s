# Git Branch Tracking Issue: `is/sensors_permission_design`

## Problem Statement
While attempting to pull changes from a remote branch, the following error occurred:
```
From github.com:healthrhythms/hr-rtm-mobile
 * [new branch]      is/sensors_permission_design -> origin/is/sensors_permission_design
Your configuration specifies to merge with the ref 'refs/heads/IS/sensors_permission_design'
from the remote, but no such ref was fetched.
```
Additionally, when trying to pull, the following message was shown:
```
There is no tracking information for the current branch.
Please specify which branch you want to merge with.
See git-pull(1) for details.

    git pull <remote> <branch>

If you wish to set tracking information for this branch you can do so with:

    git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/<branch> is/sensors_permission_design
```
### Cause
- The local branch was created from `is/sensors_permission_design`, but it did not automatically track the remote branch.
- There is a possible case sensitivity issue between `IS/sensors_permission_design` and `is/sensors_permission_design`.

## Solution
To fix the tracking issue, set the upstream branch manually using the following command:
```bash
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/is/sensors_permission_design is/sensors_permission_design
git pull
```
### Explanation
- `git branch --set-upstream-to`: Links the local branch to the remote branch so that `git pull` and `git push` commands work without needing to specify remote and branch names explicitly.
- `git pull`: Retrieves the latest changes from the remote repository and merges them into the local branch.

If there is a case sensitivity issue (e.g., `IS/` vs. `is/`), rename the local branch to match the remote branch:
```bash
git branch -m IS/sensors_permission_design is/sensors_permission_design
git fetch origin
git pull
```
---
### Outcome
After running these commands, the local branch should correctly track the remote branch, and `git pull` should work as expected without additional parameters.
